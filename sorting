# Ex.No: 7 Sorting 

### DATE:                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER :  212221040159
### AIM: 
Write a python program for sorting and inspect for failures. 
### Algorithm:
1. Start
2. Get an input from the user by prompting 
3. Run a loop form 0 to len/2.
4. Check if the characters are the same both from the start and the end till len/2. 
5. If it is, return the result that it is a palindrome.
6. Else, return that it is not a palindrome. 
7. Stop the program.
### Program:
```
 n=int(input("Enter the number of elements:"))  
arr=[]  
try:  
     for i in range(n):  
        a=float(input("Enter the element:"))  
        arr.append(a)  
        for i in range(n):  
            for j in range(n):  
                if(arr[i]<arr[j): 
                              temp = arr[i] 
                              arr[i] = arr[j] 
                              arr[j] = temp 
    print(“The array after sorting: ”) 
 for i in range(n): 
     print(arr[i],end=’ ’) 
except ValueError: 
    print(“Enter a valid number”) 
```












### Output:
![Screenshot 2024-11-08 142107](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1abbf75c-e29a-4ba9-b272-fa5182146343)


### Result:
Thus, a program to check palindrome has been written and test cases have been written and verified successfully.
