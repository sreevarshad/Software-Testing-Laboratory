## Ex.No: 12 Pytest Python program for Addition

## DATE : 
## REGISTER NUMBER :212221040159
## AIM:
To write a python program for addition of two numbers and test the test cases using Pytest.
## Algorithm:
   1. Write the python program for addition of two numbers
   2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested
   should have assert keyword at the beginning
   3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”.
   4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program
  is saved and type “pytest test_add.py” and run it.

## Program:
```
def add(a,b):
return a+b
def test_3_plus_5_equals_8():
assert add(3,5) == 8
def test_2_plus_3_equals_5():
assert add(2,3) == 6

```
## Output:
![555555](https://github.com/sreevarshad/Software-Testing-Laboratory/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-03-26%20175721.png)

## Result:
Thus, the python program for addition is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
