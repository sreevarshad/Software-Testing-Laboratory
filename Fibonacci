# Ex.No: 2 Pytest Python program for Fibonacci Series


### DATE:                                                                             
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040159

### AIM: 
To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and test the test cases using Pytest.
 
### Algorithm:

Algorithm:
1. Write the python program for addition of two numbers
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested should have
assert keyword at the beginning
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”.
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is saved and
type “pytest test_add.py” and run it.

### Program:

```
def fibR(n):
if n==1 or n==2:
return 1
return fibR(n-1)+fibR(n-2)
def test_fib_1_equals_1():
assert fibR(1) == 1
def test_fib_2_equals_1():
assert fibR(2) == 1
def test_fib_6_equals_8():
assert fibR(6) == 7

```


### Output:

### Result:
Thus, the python program for matrix multiplication is implemented and the causes for its failure is introspected successfully.
